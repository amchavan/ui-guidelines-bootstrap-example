# ALMA UI Guidelines Example — Bootstrap

This project is an example Angular 7 application showing how the 
[ALMA Web UI Guidelines](https://confluence.alma.cl/x/mwLoAQ) 
can be implemented using the Bootstrap CSS+JS front-end framework.  

It was generated with 
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
version 7.3.9.

## Development environment

To build and run this example you need to set up an Angular 
development environment.

### Node.js

Node.js is the server-side Javascript runtime, it's used to power JS 
development tools. Verify if you have a working installation by running
`node --version` — you'll need version 10.9.0 or later.

See your environment's specific instructions for  installing Node 
on https://nodejs.org/en/download  
The Node installation will include `npm`, the Node package manager.

### Angular CLI

To install the CLI globally using _npm_, enter
```$sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Clone the Git repository

Clone the Git source code repository:
```$sh
git clone https://github.com/amchavan/ui-guidelines-bootstrap-example.git

```

### Node dependencies

Change into the _ui-guidelines-bootstrap-example_ directory and install all needed dependencies:
```$sh
npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular

```

### Launch the example 

You can start the example with `ng serve --open` from the _ui-guidelines-bootstrap-example_ 
directory.  The `--open` (or just `-o`) option automatically opens your browser to 
http://localhost:4200 and refreshes the UI when you update the source code.

### External CSS definitions

**NOTE** This example relies on an external CSS file to implement the ALMA 
Web UI Guidelines. The file is part of the NPM module 
[@almaobservatory/ui-guidelines](https://github.com/amchavan/alma-ui-guidelines), 
included via a dependency entry in  _package.json_.
